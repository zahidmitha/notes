CRUD (create, read, update, delete)

GET (create)
POST (post)
PUT (update)
DELETE (delete)

With a form we do:


ACTIOn="/maps" METHOD="POST"

or

ACTIOn="/maps" METHOD="GET"

<a href="/zahid"> acceses something using relative to the entire file system

<a href="zahid"> accesses something relative to the current folder

PATCH requests are to update but they're not supported

So we fake it:

<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT/PATCH/DELETE">

Each request and response is independent or one another
This is a problem because if you need continual access to something, you need the site to maintain the state

i.e.

1) Login
2) Activate action

2 depends on 1.

How do we solve this? Cookies.

Cookies go into the response headers and keep track of actions.

i.e. Login request has an addition which writes a cookie

Cookies allow us to create a "session". Sessions are a concept that allow the website's state to remain and store information about the user/keep the state.
