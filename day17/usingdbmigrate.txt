# This is what we did. Try and avoid using scaffolds when you're building your controller

rails new --database postgresql
change database.yml
rake db:create
rails generate scaffold Test
rake db:migrate
rails generate migration ChangeColumns
rake db:migrate
rails generate model NewModel column:type
rake db:migrate


create controller
add actions to controllers (remember these are just methods in your controller)
update routes.rb
create some views
