Inheritance

Everything is an object

There is a blueprint in ruby called object

Every single object that we instanciate inherits from object

CLass object defines a set of core behaviour that affects the whole ruby environment

Class object
	def to_s
	#inherits from object
	(i.e.) first_name + ' ' + last_name
	end

	def inspect
	end

	def object_id
	end
end

All the above are inherited by ALL objects.

All classes automatically inherit from the object class

Classes that we immediately inherit from are called the SUPERCLASS.

Overriding is when you rename your method to ovverride an existing oen you inherit from i.e. you create a method called to_s
